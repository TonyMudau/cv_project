# CV Maker 

In this project I attempt to build a CV maker web application using flask. 

## Plan
The idea is to create a form that takes in users inputs from general questions like name, qualifications, likes and dislikes and use the PDF module to create a CV from this information. 

# Modules 

- Flask 
- FPDF

# Procedure
I begin by 
1. Changing the forms.py
2. Request form data in app.py
3. Edit .html form
